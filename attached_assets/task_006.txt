# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement upload and metadata UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Streamlit UI components for file upload and metadata input.
# Details:
Create upload UI module in app/ui/upload.py with components:
- create_metadata_form(): Create form for experiment metadata input
  - Project name dropdown with "add new" option
  - Operator name dropdown with "add new" option
  - Cell name dropdown with "add new" option
  - Machine used dropdown with "add new" option
  - Date picker
- create_file_upload(): Create file upload widgets for Step.csv and Detail.csv
- handle_new_metadata_item(): Handle adding new items to dropdown lists

Implement session state management to preserve user inputs between Streamlit reruns.
Create database queries to populate dropdown options from existing records.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI components manually in Streamlit. Verify dropdowns populate correctly from database. Test "add new" functionality. Verify file upload works with test files.
