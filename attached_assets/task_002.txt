# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement database models and connection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create SQLModel classes for the database schema and implement database connection functionality.
# Details:
Implement the following SQLModel classes in app/models:
- Cell: Store cell information (ID, capacity, chemistry)
- Machine: Store machine information
- Experiment: Store experiment metadata
- Step: Store step data with calculated fields
- Detail: Store time series data
- SavedView: Store saved dashboard views

Implement database connection functions:
- create_db_and_tables(): Initialize database and create tables
- get_engine(): Get SQLAlchemy engine with connection pooling

Create database migration script to handle schema updates.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests to verify model relationships and constraints. Test database connection and table creation with a test database. Verify foreign key relationships work correctly.
