# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure, install dependencies, and set up the development environment for the Battery ETL Dashboard.
# Details:
Create a new Python project with the following structure:
- /app: Main application code
- /app/models: Database models
- /app/etl: ETL processing logic
- /app/ui: Streamlit UI components
- /app/visualization: Plotting functions
- /app/utils: Utility functions
- /tests: Test files

Install required dependencies:
- streamlit
- pandas
- plotly
- sqlmodel
- psycopg2-binary
- python-dotenv

Create a requirements.txt file and a .env file template for database configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies install correctly and the project structure is properly set up. Run a basic Streamlit app to confirm the environment is working.
