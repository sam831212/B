# Battery ETL Dashboard Implementation Progress
Based on the project structure and completed tasks, here's the current status:

Completed Task 4 - Data Transformation Logic
Located in: app/etl/transformation.py
This file contains fully implemented functions for:

calculate_c_rate(): C-rate calculation
calculate_soc(): SOC calculation using Coulomb counting
extract_ocv_values(): OCV extraction from rest steps
calculate_temperature_metrics(): Temperature statistics calculation
transform_data(): Main transformation function integrating all calculations
Partially Completed Tasks:

Task 1 - Project Structure
Located in root directory and app/ folder:

Basic directory structure created (app/, tests/, etc.)
Dependencies installed
Environment configuration initiated
Files: .env.template, app/utils/config.py
Task 2 - Database Models
Located in: app/models/database.py

Initial database model structure
Basic connection functionality
Task 3 - CSV Parsing
Located in: app/etl/extraction.py

Basic extraction module structure
Initial CSV parsing functions
Remaining tasks (5-10) are pending implementation:

Task 5: Data Validation & Preview
Task 6: Upload & Metadata UI
Task 7: Step Selection & Processing UI
Task 8: Visualization & Dashboard UI
Task 9: Database Loading & Retrieval
Task 10: Integration & Main Application
