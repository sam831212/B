Overall Goal: Decompose metadata.py into smaller, more focused modules. We'll create new subdirectories for UI components and services.

1. Create New Directory Structures:

First, create the following new directories within your app folder if they don't already exist:

app/ui/components/ (for individual Streamlit UI components)
app/services/ (for backend logic, data processing, and database interactions that support the UI)
2. Relocate Functions to New Modules:

Here's how you can distribute the functions from metadata.py into new, more specialized files:

A. UI Components (app/ui/components/)

File: app/ui/components/entity_management_ui.py

Purpose: Handles UI for managing database entities like Cells and Machines.
Functions to move:
render_entity_management
render_cell_management
cell_reference_check
render_machine_management
machine_reference_check
File: app/ui/components/experiment_info_ui.py

Purpose: Manages the UI for experiment metadata input.
Functions to move:
render_experiment_metadata
save_experiment_metadata
File: app/ui/components/file_handling_ui.py

Purpose: UI for uploading user files and loading example files.
Functions to move:
render_file_upload_section
process_uploaded_files
render_example_files_section
process_loaded_example_files
find_example_file_pairs
File: app/ui/components/data_display_ui.py

Purpose: UI for displaying file statistics and validation results.
Functions to move:
display_file_statistics
display_validation_results
display_validation_summary
File: app/ui/components/selected_data_processing_ui.py

Purpose: UI related to processing data that might have been selected or prepared in a previous step/preview.
Functions to move:
render_preview_data_section
handle_selected_steps_save
B. Services (app/services/)

File: app/services/file_processing_service.py

Purpose: Core logic for file data extraction and the main processing pipeline. While it contains Streamlit calls for user feedback (e.g., st.spinner), separating it clarifies the workflow.
Functions to move:
get_file_data_and_metadata
handle_file_processing_pipeline
File: app/services/database_service.py

Purpose: Helper functions for direct database interactions.
Functions to move:
check_file_already_processed
save_experiment_to_db
save_steps_to_db
save_measurements_to_db
save_processed_files_to_db
update_experiment_end_date
File: app/services/validation_service.py (or integrate into validation.py if more appropriate)

Purpose: Logic for validating file formats and data.
Functions to move:
validate_files
generate_validation_results (Note: You import generate_validation_report from app.etl.validation but also have a local generate_validation_results. Review if these are redundant or serve different specific purposes. If generate_validation_results is purely for preparing data for the UI, it could also live in data_display_ui.py or be a helper within it.)
C. Utilities (utils)

File: app/utils/data_helpers.py (or an existing relevant utility file)
Purpose: General data conversion or helper utilities.
Functions to move:
convert_datetime_to_python (Note: convert_numpy_types is already correctly imported from app.etl.)
3. Refactor the Main Page Orchestrator:

The current metadata.py file will be significantly slimmed down. You can choose to:
Keep the name metadata.py.
Rename it to something like app/ui/upload_orchestrator_page.py or app/ui/experiment_setup_page.py to better reflect its new role.
Primary Content: This file will now mainly contain the render_upload_page function.
Functionality: render_upload_page will be responsible for structuring the page and calling the various render_... functions imported from your new app/ui/components/ modules.
4. Update Imports:

After moving the functions, you'll need to update all import statements:
In the new files, add necessary imports (e.g., import streamlit as st, import pandas as pd, models from app.models, utilities from app.utils, services from app.services).
In the refactored metadata.py (or its new name), change imports to call functions from their new locations. For example:
Benefits of This Refactoring:

Improved Readability: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand.
Enhanced Maintainability: Changes related to a specific piece of functionality can be made in its dedicated module without affecting others as much.
Better Organization: Code is grouped logically by its role (UI component, service, utility).
Potential for Reusability: Well-defined UI components or services can be more easily reused elsewhere.
Simplified Testing: Smaller modules are generally easier to unit test.
This plan provides a structured way to break down your large file. Remember to test thoroughly after each significant set of changes
