# Battery ETL Dashboard - Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Battery ETL Dashboard implementation according to the task breakdown in the project requirements.

## Task 1: Set up project structure and environment ✓

- Created project directory structure:
  - `/app`: Main application code
  - `/app/models`: Database models
  - `/app/etl`: ETL processing logic
  - `/app/ui`: Streamlit UI components
  - `/app/visualization`: Plotting functions
  - `/app/utils`: Utility functions
  - `/tests`: Test files

- Installed required dependencies:
  - streamlit
  - pandas
  - plotly
  - sqlmodel
  - psycopg2-binary
  - python-dotenv

- Created configuration utilities:
  - Environment variable loading with python-dotenv
  - Database connection configuration
  - Application settings

- Set up Streamlit configuration with `.streamlit/config.toml`

## Task 2: Implement database models and connection ✓

- Created SQLModel classes for database schema:
  - `Experiment`: Representing a battery test experiment
  - `Step`: Representing a test step within an experiment
  - `Measurement`: Representing detailed measurements within a step
  - `ProcessedFile`: Tracking processed files to prevent duplicates

- Implemented database connection functionality:
  - Connection setup and management
  - Session handling
  - Database initialization
  - Connection testing

- Created database utility functions:
  - `init_db()`: Initialize database and create tables
  - `get_session()`: Get a new database session
  - `test_db_connection()`: Test database connectivity

## Task 3: Implement data extraction from CSV files (Completed)

- Created extraction.py module with functions for processing ChromaLex CSV files:
  - `validate_csv_format()`: Verify that the CSV files have required headers
  - `map_step_types()`: Standardize step types (charge, discharge, rest)
  - `calculate_file_hash()`: Generate file hash for tracking processed files
  - `parse_step_csv()`: Process Step.csv file with specific header format
  - `parse_detail_csv()`: Process Detail.csv file with specific header format
  - `load_and_preprocess_files()`: Load and preprocess both CSV files

- Created example CSV files for testing:
  - `Step.csv`: Contains step-level data
  - `Detail.csv`: Contains detailed measurement data
  - `Bad_Headers.csv`: Example of invalid format for testing validations

- Enhanced upload interface with validation:
  - File format validation using `validate_csv_format()`
  - Data preprocessing using `load_and_preprocess_files()`
  - Database storage of experiment, steps, and measurements
  - Duplicate file detection using file hashing

- Started implementing extraction module for ChromaLex format
- Created validation for CSV formats

## Task 4: Implement data transformation (Completed)

- ✓ Created transformation.py module with functions for processing battery data
- ✓ Implemented SOC calculation algorithm using Coulomb counting
- ✓ Added C-rate calculation based on current and nominal capacity
- ✓ Created OCV extraction from rest steps
- ✓ Implemented temperature metrics calculation
- ✓ Added multi-language support (English and Chinese) for CSV file formats
- ✓ Enhanced extraction module to auto-detect CSV format
- ✓ Created test_transformations.py for testing SOC calculations without database operations
- ✓ Fixed SOC calculation implementation for proper Coulomb counting

## Task 5: Implement data validation and preview (Implemented)

- Implemented basic data validation functions:
  - `validate_soc_range()`: Check if SOC values are within expected range
  - `validate_c_rate()`: Verify C-rate values are positive and within expected ranges
  - `validate_data_continuity()`: Check for gaps in timestamps
  - `validate_value_jumps()`: Identify sudden jumps in measurement values

- Implemented validation report generation:
  - `generate_validation_report()`: Compile validation results into a comprehensive report

## Task 6: Implement UI components (Partly Implemented)

- Created basic UI structure with navigation
- Implemented page routing with session state
- Created placeholders for main UI components

- Implemented Settings page:
  - Database connection settings
  - File format settings
  - UI preference settings
  - Test connection functionality

- Implemented Upload page:
  - Experiment information form
  - File upload components
  - Basic file statistics display
  - Preview of uploaded data

- Implemented Dashboard page structure:
  - Overview tab
  - Capacity analysis tab
  - Voltage analysis tab
  - Temperature analysis tab
  - Placeholders for visualization components
